                            <p>Do you have a Busy Lifestyle? After a long day of work, is Scooping the last thing you want to do? Are you Tired of the smell? Is your Cat also tired of not having a Clean Litter Box? </p>
                            <p>Well, there is a solution for you: the ComfyCat Zen Self-Cleaning litter box. After your cat is done doing its business, the ComfyCat Zen automatically goes to work. Its 70-degree 
                            horizontal rake deep cleans the litter bed and separates waste from the clean litter. Waste goes to an enclosed 2L waste drawer. Just remove the content to your garbage once a week. </p>
                            <p>That's it! Hands off otherwise! Your Scooping days are over!</p>

                            <p>ComfyCat Zen’s dimensions are 30L x 18W x 17H inches (77L x 46W x 44H cm). This is big enough for even bigger cats to get in, move around inside and be comfy. The Height of the entry chamber is 11.2 inches (28.5cm). Step in is also easy as the tracking pad is only 6 inches (15cm) off the ground – great for older cats and kittens. Cats adopt ComfyCat Zen very quickly (Cool, another Box!).</p>
                            <p>Tracking is minimized thanks to the semi-enclosed design and thanks to the tracking pad.</p>

                            <p>ComfyCat Zen works with all Clumping Litters with smaller particles. </p>
                            <p><strong>But for the Good of your Cat, please Go Natural.</strong> We would like you to know that most litters contain toxic chemicals dangerous for your cat’s Health.</p>
                            <p>Silica dust, found in most clumping litters, is a known carcinogen for both humans and cats when inhaled and can cause cancer. Clay litter contains Bentonite which can cause intestinal blockages if ingested. And it’s terrible for the planet with hundreds of millions of pounds ending up every year dumped in landfills. An environmental disaster.</p>
                            <p>We recommend our 100% Natural Premium Clumping litter. <strong>Made of all-natural ingredients</strong> good for your fur baby: Corn-Kernels and Soybeans (Tofu). The strength of Corn combined with the super absorbent Plant fibres found in Tofu quickly absorb liquids and produce solid, tight clumps. <strong>3x Better Clumping</strong> than Clay and most leading brands. <strong>100% healthy</strong> for your cat and good for the environment as 100% natural. Very strong odor control, low tracking, low dust & flushable. Delivered to your doorstep. </p>
