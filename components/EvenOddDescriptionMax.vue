                            <h2>No More Scooping!</h2>
                            <p>Do you have a Busy Lifestyle? After a long day of work, is Scooping the last thing you want to do?<br>Are you Tired of the smell? Is your Cat also tired of not having a Clean Litter Box? Do you also want a disinfected cat litter box, free of 99.9% of common bacteria, fungi and viruses responsible for bad smells and cat illnesses? </p>
                            <p>Well, there is a solution for you: the ComfyCat Max Self-Cleaning litter box. <br>
After your cat is done doing its business, the ComfyCat Max automatically goes to work.  <br>
Its rotating rake deep cleans the litter bed and separates waste from the clean litter and deposits waste into a 6L waste drawer (Just remove the content to your garbage every 5 days). <br>
Then the UV sterilization cycle starts to kill and disinfect 99.9% of all common bacteria, fungi and viruses responsible for bad smells and cat illnesses. The Ultraviolet sterilization process safely stops when movements are detected. Once the UV cycle is done, the device is on standby mode again.</p>

                            <p>ComfyCat Max has an infrared sensor that detect cats of all sizes (including kittens). This is much safer than competing devices that use outdated weight-based sensors that cannot safely track kittens.</p>

                            <h2>Generous Interior Dimensions in a Compact, Modern Design. Your Cats will be Comfy.</h2>
                            <p>Cats need enough interior space in their litter to do their business. Many automatic cat litters do not provide enough space and accidents happen with some ‘leftovers’ staying on their furs because cats are too squeezed inside…not a pleasant experience for them and their owners!</p>
                            <p>ComfyCat Max has a lot of interior/vertical space for cats to comfortably do their business: 20 inches (50cm) of interior vertical headroom from the litter bed. This is thanks to its intelligent design (the garbage container is on top allowing for maximum interior space with the litter bed at ground level). Cats are thus super comfy and even the largest cats (up to 18 pounds, 8kg) can get in, move around inside and be comfy when doing their business. ComfyCat Max can hold a generous 6L of litter.</p>
                            <p>Cats adopt ComfyCat Max very quickly (Cool, another Box!).</p>
                            <p>Remarkably, even though it offers more interior space, ComfyCat Max is much more compact than other automatic cat litter boxes with dimensions of 23.6L x 23.6W x 20.0H inches (60L x 60 x 50H cm). It only uses an overall floor area of 3.9 sqft (0.36m2) and fits well even in smaller spaces.</p>
                            <p>Do you care about your interior design? ComfyCat Max has a sleek and modern & minimalist design with soft curves that looks beautiful anywhere in your home, unlike the bulky designs of rotating devices.</p>

                            <p>ComfyCat Max works with all Clumping Litters with smaller particles. <strong>But for the Good of your Cat, please Go Natural</strong>. We would like you to know that most litters contain toxic chemicals dangerous for your cat’s Health.</p>
                            <p>Silica dust, found in most clumping litters, is a known carcinogen for both humans and cats when inhaled and can cause cancer. Clay litter contains Bentonite which can cause intestinal blockages if ingested. And it’s terrible
for the planet with hundreds of millions of pounds ending up every year dumped in landfills. An environmental disaster.</p>
<p>We recommend our 100% Natural Premium Clumping litter. <strong>Made of all-natural ingredients</strong> good for your fur baby: Corn-Kernels and Soybeans (Tofu). The strength of Corn combined with the super absorbent Plant
fibres found in Tofu quickly absorb liquids and produce solid, tight clumps.
<strong>3x Better Clumping</strong> than Clay and most leading brands. <strong>100% healthy</strong>
for your cat and good for the environment as 100% natural. Very strong
odour control, low tracking, low dust & flushable. Delivered to your doorstep.</p>
